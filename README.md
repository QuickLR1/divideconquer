# Divide & Conquer Algorithms

This project implements classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with metrics collection.

## Implemented Algorithms
- MergeSort (with buffer reuse and small-n cutoff)
- QuickSort (randomized pivot, tail recursion elimination)
- Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)
- Closest Pair of Points (O(n log n))

## Metrics
- Execution time
- Recursion depth
- Comparisons
- Allocations

## Workflow
- `main` branch → only stable releases (tag v0.1, v1.0)
- `feature/*` branches → active development
